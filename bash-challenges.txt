Challenge #1

    Suppose you connect frequently to a server located in a remote data center by running: ssh -l u123h -p 9956 191.169.0.1 
    Create an alias named main for the command and make it persistent after reboot.

	$ sudo vim ~/-bashrc
	    alias main=ssh -l u123h -p 9956 191.169.0.1 


Challenge #2

    Create a Bash script named script1.sh. Add the shebang.
    Define a variable called country that holds the country you are living in.
    Print the message: You live in YOUR_COUNTRY.
    Run the script in different ways.

	$ vim script1.sh
	    #!/bin/bash
 	    echo "You live in México"
	
	$ bash script1.sh
	$ source script1.sh


Challenge #3

    Create a script and define two string variables.
    Add a commented line after the shebang and another inline comment.
    Create a new variable by concatenating the two string variables.
    Run the script.

	$ vim strings.sh

	    #!/bin/bash
	    
	    # Just a regular comment
	    os=Linux
	    course=DevOps # In ztm ;)

	    studying="I am currently working on $os, doing the course $course"
	    echo "$studying"

	$ source ./strings.sh
 

Challenge #4
 
    Develop a Bash script that creates a new group and a new username.  The group will be the user’s secondary group.
    The username and the group will be given as input by the user that runs the script.
    The script will also display the last 2 lines from the files where the users and the groups are saved in Linux.
    Test the script by running it as root.

	$ vim users.sh
	
	    #!/bin/bash
	
	    echo -n "Enter the username: "
	    read username
	    echo -n "Enter the groupname: "
	    read groupname

	    sudo groupadd $groupname
	    sudo useradd -m $username -G $groupname -s /bin/bash

	    echo "#################"
 	    tail -n 2 /etc/passwd

	    echo "#################"
	    tail -n 2 /etc/group

	$ sudo bash users.sh


Challenge #5

    Create a script called fix_permissions.sh that prompts the user for a directory and changes the permissions of all subdirectories to 755 and to all files to 644 recursively.

	$ vim fix_permissions.sh

	    #!/bin/bash

	    echo -n "Specify the directory you want to fix"
	    read directory

	    if [ -f "$directory" ]
	    then    

        	find $directory -type f -exec chmod -R 644 {} \;
	        find $directory -type d -exec chmod -R 755 {} \;
        
	    else    
	        echo "WARNING: The directory specified is not correct or doesn't exist"
        
	    fi
