Secure the SSH Daemon:
  * Change the listening Port to 2266
  * Allow only a single non-privileged user to connect to the SSH server
  * Disable root login entirely.

    in /etc/ssh/sshd.config:

    Port 2266
    MaxSessions 1
    PermitRootLogin no


Create a directory and a file in the userâ€™s home directory.
Using scp, copy both the file and the directory to the remote Linux VM where the SSH daemon is running.
    $ mkdir -p scpTest/file1.txt
    $ scp -P 2266 -r scpTest/ supertramp@192.168.0.103:~ 
  
Using scp, copy a file from the remote VM where the SSH daemon is running to the local machine, in the current directory.
    $ scp -P 2266 supertramp@192.168.0.102:~/scpTest/file1.txt ~
